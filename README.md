# Train-Schedule-Homework-

A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. The website provides current information about various trains, their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Instructions:
The Administrator will be able to add in additional trains (i.e. Train Name, Destination, First Train Time, and Frequency). The train being added will be added to the Firebase DB and then be displayed on the train scheduler. The Next Arrival and Minutes Away will be auto-updated based on the current time.
